# Description
The goal of this project is to recommend a learning model for predicting the average time variable in the test times data. This is accomplished through the use of evaluation techniques such as R-squared, plots of the residuals, and the mean squared error for the follow learning algorithms:
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Linear Regression

# Data
The data has been copied over from the [sorting algorithm analysis](https://github.com/irisfield/sorting-algorithms-analysis) project.
